# Usage: To use this addon, create a new flashcard with a note type containing the 
# word 'japanese'. Type the word you want to create a new card for into the field
# with the same name as the 'triggerNoteFieldName' variable below. By default, 
# the 'Expression' field is used. The initial term you enter into the card's 
# field can be in full Japanese, in kana, in romaji, or even in English. 
# When you tab or click out of the field, this addon will automatically query 
# Jisho.org for information about the word. If you entered the word in a non-standard
# way, this addon will replace what you typed with the proper form of the word as 
# returned by the Jisho.org search API. (Ex. Typing 'house' into the field then 
# tabbing out will cause what you typed to be replaced with '家', and will additionally
# fill in the other fields on the card as appropriate. The fields will be filled 
# with information from the *first* result returned by the Jisho.org search API, 
# so if the wrong information comes back, try altering the text you're using.
# The field which triggers the# addon, as well as what information goes in which field, 
# can be changed as described below. Note that this addon *requires* an active
# internet connection to function.

# Enable/Disable Auto Generation: By right-clicking while creating a new card, 
# you can enable and disable the addon as needed to make manual changes to 
# card fields without the addon stepping on your toes.

# This addon is fully compatible with the furigana lookup function of the 
# 'Japanese Language Support' addon, and the two should not normally interfere with 
# each other. By default, they trigger off of the same card field and apply 
# to the same types of cards.

# Trigger Field: By default, the addon runs when the user tabs out of 
# the 'Expression' field after entering some text. To change which field 
# triggers the addon, change the variable below to the name of the field
# you want to use.

triggerNoteFieldName = 'Expression' # Script is run when tabbing out of this field

# The noteNameIdentifier is a string that must exist in the name of your note type for 
# this script to be executed for that note type. By default, any note type whose name 
# contains the word 'japanese' will attempt to execute this script, just like the 
# Japanese Language Support plugin.

noteNameIdentifier = 'japanese'

# Default Supported Fields: 
# The word is placed in the 'Expression' field
# The first definition is placed in the 'Meaning' field
# The second definition is placed in the '2ndDef' field
# The part of speech is placed in the 'PartOfSpeech' field
# The first tag is placed in the 'Tags' field
# The first restriction is placed in the 'Restrictions' field
# The first antonym is placed in the 'Antonyms' field
# The first info is placed in the 'Info' field
# The reading of the word is placed in the 'Reading' field, 
#   unless the Japanese Language Support addon is installed.
#
# These mappings can be changed by changing the field names below. 
# For example, if the name of your second definition field were 
# 'Definition2', you would change '2ndDef' below to 'Definition2'.
# If you don't wish to use a mapping, just change the field name to 
# ''. Fields fail silently, so just put the fields on your note type
# that you intend to use.
